## STACK
stack is a data structure in programming. It is just like a pile of plates.

●If you want to add a new plate, you put it on top. or    
●If you want to remove a plate, you remove it on top. or     
●If you want the plate at the bottom, you must frist remove all the plates on top.    

Such an arrangement is called *Last In First Out* - the last item that is the first item to go out.
